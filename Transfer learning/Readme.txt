The methods include Deep Learning based approaches to create classifier frameworks which 
->perform end to end data set manipulation, 
->ensembling,
->training, 
->test augmentation and detection.
->Transfer learning using Resnet(ResNet50,ResNet152) and Densenet(DenseNet169) architectures was performed.

We aim to deal with the various discrepancies in the images and the dataset by taking various data pre processing and augmentation
methods.Here we got an accuracy of 0.96 and we have attached the Screenshots and respective code in this folder.
