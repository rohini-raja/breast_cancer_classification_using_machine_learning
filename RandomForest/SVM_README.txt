The analysis is divided into four sections:
1. Identifying the problem  and Data Sources
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is  malignant or Benign
We constructed a predictive model using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor.
The diagnosis of a breast tumor is a binary variable (benign or malignant).
We also evaluated the model using confusion matrix the receiver operating curves (ROC), which are essential in assessing and interpreting the fitted model.

SVM classification gives an accuracy of 0.95
and after performing Principal Component Analysis we get an  optimised accuracy of 0.97.
and we have attached the output screenshots in the output screenshots folder.
